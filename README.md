The Adaptive Inference Pipeline for Dedicated Servers
Optimizing Video Frame Processing on Apple Silicon
Abstract
This paper introduces the Adaptive Inference Pipeline, a dedicated-server solution designed to maximize throughput and minimize latency for real-time video frame analysis. Built on a Manager–Worker architecture with a shared memory buffer, the system leverages Apple Silicon’s heterogeneous compute units (ANE, GPU, CPU) through a calibration-driven weighted task assignment. Unlike dynamic schedulers, this approach achieves predictable, efficient performance in controlled environments, making it particularly suited for proprietary inference workloads.

1. Introduction
Video inference workloads face a dual challenge:

Throughput – sustaining high frame-per-second (FPS) rates without bottlenecks.

Latency – minimizing delays between frame capture and result delivery.

On Apple Silicon, multiple compute units exist (ANE, GPU, CPU), each with different performance characteristics. Standard schedulers often underutilize these heterogeneous resources or impose overhead through dynamic monitoring.
The Adaptive Inference Pipeline addresses this by combining:

Manager–Worker coordination

Shared memory optimization

Calibration-based weighted distribution

2. Core Architecture
2.1 Manager–Worker Pattern
Manager (Orchestrator)
Reads frames into shared memory.

Assigns frames to workers based on calibrated performance ratios.

Collects inference results from worker queues.

Workers (Specialized Inference Engines)
ANE Worker: Runs YOLOv11 Core ML model on the Apple Neural Engine.

GPU Worker: Executes YOLOv11 PyTorch model with MPS backend.

CPU Worker: Provides a final fallback using PyTorch CPU backend.

2.2 Shared Memory Buffer
Frames written once into a common memory block.

Workers read directly via offsets (no copies).

Minimizes bandwidth usage and I/O latency.

Requires lightweight synchronization (e.g., reference counting or ring buffer locking).

3. Weighted Hybrid Task Assignment
3.1 Calibration Phase
Benchmark inference throughput of ANE, GPU, CPU for the given model.

Derive performance ratios, e.g.:

ANE = 7× CPU speed

GPU = 3× CPU speed

3.2 Assignment Cycle
Example: For 11 frames → {ANE: 7, GPU: 3, CPU: 1}

All workers complete sub-batches simultaneously, minimizing idle time.

3.3 Benefits
Predictable throughput.

Minimal Manager overhead (no continuous monitoring).

Full utilization of Apple Silicon’s heterogeneous cores.

4. Why This Works on Dedicated Servers
Optimal Resource Utilization

ANE prioritized for efficiency, GPU for throughput, CPU as safety net.

Minimal Overhead

No dynamic scheduling → leaner Manager process.

Reduced I/O Cost

Shared memory prevents redundant copies of high-resolution frames.

Rock-Solid Predictability

Dedicated environment = stable calibration, consistent performance.

5. Considerations & Extensions
Failure Tolerance:

Add a lightweight watchdog to detect slow/stalled workers.

Calibration Drift:

Refresh ratios periodically to account for thermal throttling or driver changes.

Latency-Sensitive Workloads:

Optionally add a “next available worker” mode for ultra-low latency.

Future Scalability:

Model extends naturally to multi-ANE or heterogeneous GPU clusters.

6. Conclusion
The Adaptive Inference Pipeline demonstrates that a calibrated, weighted scheduling strategy paired with shared memory optimization can outperform dynamic schedulers in dedicated server environments. By fully utilizing Apple Silicon’s heterogeneous compute units, the architecture ensures high throughput, low latency, and predictable performance — essential for large-scale proprietary inference deployments.
